## 🧠 How It Works

- Time updates every 10 milliseconds using `setInterval()`.
- JavaScript tracks hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- Buttons are enabled/disabled based on stopwatch state:
  - Start is disabled when running
  - Resume is enabled only after stopping
- Display updates in the format:  
  `HH:MM:SS.MS`
